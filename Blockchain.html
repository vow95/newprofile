                                            Counterfeit products are important and growing global problem, particularly in developing countries. The annual market value of counterfeit goods has surpassed billions of dollars. One of the reasons for products counterfeiting is the imperfect supply
                                            chain system in these industries. Products change ownership from manufacturers to wholesaler, distributer and then selling points before it reaches the customer. Information is not shared between systems, manufacturers
                                            do not know what happened to their products in current supply chain system, products regulatory authority has no visibility of the system, and companies cannot follow-up customer. In this paper, we explain how
                                            to use Blockchain technology in production supply chain to add traceability, visibility and security to the products supply system. The proposed system will be used in products industry to track the products
                                            from its manufacturing until its delivery to customer. A permissioned Blockchain will be used for storing transactions and only trusted parties will be allowed to join the network and push data to Blockchain.

                                        <h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

                                        <p>
                                            Building a brand and develop a high quality products are complex process that take several years of the hard work to reach costumer's trust and loyalty. When all of the steps have been completed and a standard product has been developed, the next challenge
                                            for manufacturers is to deliver the product to the end customer in its original form, ensuring that the customer receives a genuine product created by a legitimate manufacturer rather than a counterfeiter. However,
                                            the present Supply Chain Management (SCM) system in the products business is antiquated, since it lacks visibility and traceability over goods distribution, and it is unable to withstand cyber-security threats
                                            in the twenty-first century. As a result of this SCM environment, counterfeit items are produced, distributed, and consumed. Counterfeit goods producers frequently imitate authentic brand logos to create bogus
                                            products that are utilized in everyday life. Counterfeiting is one of the oldest and most lucrative businesses, but technological advancements have greatly aided counterfeiters' operations [1], which is why
                                            the FBI has dubbed counterfeiting the crime of the twenty-first century [2], because counterfeited goods can be produced in large quantities in a short amount of time. Counterfeiting, according to the International
                                            Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), has grown to be one of the world's largest and fastest-growing illicit enterprises, with an annual worth of more than US$ 600 billion [3]. The valuable products business
                                            needs an effective supply chain management system to avoid counterfeit items, and Blockchain technology is the greatest available tool for developing a faultless SCM system. Blockchain is a distributed ledger
                                            system (originally described by Satoshi Nakamoto under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [4]) that has shown considerable adaptability in recent years, with a range of industry sectors looking for methods
                                            to incorporate its capabilities into their operations. Although the financial services industry has received most of the attention thus far, initiatives in other servicerelated fields including as healthcare,
                                            energy, and law firms have begun to use this technology. The benefits of Blockchain are obvious for any product that goes through a delicate manufacturing process and has extensive reputational difficulties
                                            linked with the finished product. When privacy and data security are the most important considerations, Blockchain is the ideal option.

                                        <h3>II. BACKGROUND REVIEW</h3>
                                        <li>A. Why Blockchain?</li>
                                        <p>
                                            To aggregate up what a Blockchain technology, it is a public ledger of all transactions that have been executed and shared among all participants in a distributed, secure network without any central server. Every participant verifies each transaction
                                            in the ledger and, once entered, no one can erase it. A Blockchain has an accurate, detailed and verifiable record with a timestamp of every single transaction or digital event ever made. Every node on the network
                                            keeps a local copy of the ledger, and any slight changes in the local ledger are replicated to the entire network, with each node updating their local ledger. It has no influence on the network if one node fails
                                            or is unplugged. The security of Blockchain technology in a system like production SCM is the primary reason to utilize it. Blockchain can assist to boost confidence and reduce bias in traditional supply chain
                                            systems. Participants can anonymously swap digital assets using Blockchain, as they do not need to know or trust each other or a third party for their transaction. As a result, in a trustless society, Blockchain
                                            is the greatest alternative for transferring trust. One of the reasons we recommend Blockchain for production SCM systems is that it is the most effective way to track a product's travel across the supply chain.
                                            Every time the product's ownership changes, a new transaction is added to the Blockchain. Keeping track of a product's history makes it simple to discover its true origins and milestones. The potential of Blockchain
                                            is not restricted to the production of bitcoin; it can also be used to generate and track any sort of digital asset. When INFORMATION SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT-KKU a manufacturer creates a product and registers it
                                            on the network, it becomes a digital asset that can be transferred to other participants in the same way that bitcoin can. In terms of privacy protection, Blockchain is once again at the top of the list. Every
                                            member in a Blockchain network is given a public and private keys as an identify. Every transaction is done from one participant's public key to the public key of the other, and each participant's private data
                                            is kept private. The private key using to make a signature where no one can deny an action. Moreover, no one can read or take the data without the private key related to the receiver’s public key. The smart
                                            contract is the last and most essential justification for implementing Blockchain in a production SCM system. A smart contract is a piece of code that contains the real rights and obligations of all signees,
                                            including the terms and conditions for payment and delivery of goods and services, and may be automatically performed. Smart contracts can give Blockchain additional intelligence and power. They may be utilized
                                            to create cutting-edge bespoke Blockchain-based systems that are state-of-the-art [5].

                                        <li>B. Characteristics Of Blockchain</li>


                                        <p>
                                            Blockchain technology has many characteristics. They are listed below: <br>1. The Public ledger. Every node in the Blockchain network can write/read and work like a golden source in the third-party systems.<br>                                            2. Proof-of-Work. Each block will be accepted in the Blockchain should be under a special condition determined by the majority of participants in the Blockchain network. In the private Blockchain, it involves
                                            Business policy and terms of a contract, which is called Smart Contract. Similarly, each block accepted provided it contains an answer to a complex mathematical problem. <br>3. Verification Entry. Every node
                                            performs the proof of work by verifying each transaction that is initiated inside the chain. The transaction will be accepted and recorded in the ledger once all nodes have verified it. <br>4. Customizable Fields.
                                            Metadata where the owner can add some information and once the block has been entered; more importantly, information can never be erased. <br>5. Native Token. The ownership of the block in the chain can be transferred
                                            from user to user. Bitcoins and some other financial applications permit transfer of the ownership of an asset or property. <br>6. Smart Property. The controlling Native token characteristic – is the ownership
                                            of a property or asset- via Blockchain. <br>7. Independency among Nodes. The Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network in almost real-time that provides this special level of security in this technology.

                                        <h3>III. PROPOSED SULUTION</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            We realized that the production industry needs an updated supply chain system i.e. Blockchain technology can provide the highest level of transparency, security and privacy (Figure 1). The new system's goal is to include Blockchain technology's characteristics
                                            and bring traceability and security to the industrial supply chain, as well as offer insight to SCM system makers. In situations when data privacy and accessibility are required at the same time, Blockchain
                                            technology is the ideal option. Every time a product changes hands, the transaction may be recorded in order to generate a permanent record of the product's life cycle, from creation to sale. This will drastically
                                            minimize the amount of time, money, and human error that now occurs in transactions. To integrate Blockchain technology into a Production supply chain system, we must first comprehend how the Blockchain ledger
                                            works. At first, each node in the chain can create an account related to wallet. A cryptographically secure key pair is integrated into the this wallet as an identity method.

                                            Now, to provide more understanding we will explain the process from the beginning. Each manufacturer will be allowed credentials to push data to the Blockchain. Therefore, they can generate a QR code for each product by enter their productid which will
                                            be integrated with more information from our side to make it more secure. Generating a new QR code means mining new block in the chain. In other words, restricting the supply chain to start only from the manufacturer
                                            means that no way for any counterfeit product to be in the chain. On the other hand, each node can scan the QR code to trace the supply chain of the product which provided by the public ledger in Blockchain
                                            and know each owner for this product on the supply chain (Figure 3). Nodes in product supply chain management include the producer, packager, and customer, among others. On the network, each of these members
                                            will be identifiable by their unique key pair. Precious items will be considered assets, with each having its own unique key. In the form of a QR code, the ID will be affixed to the merchandise. According to
                                            that, each node on the can make a transaction for the assets related to their wallet and transfer the ownership from one to the other in the chain.

                                                Traceability. Once a product is manufactured, it is registered on the Blockchain, where it can then be tracked, traced, and validated at each stage of its journey. As the physical ownership of a goods changes, the ownership of that product will also change
                                                on the Blockchain network. Product makers will be able to track their products' progress from manufacturing through packagers and then to distributors at any time. Only trusted manufacturing can mine new
                                                blocks in the chain. Therefore, no way to add counterfeit products to the Blockchain. Each mined block has a new product ID which will be a QR code for this product.
                                            </li>
                                            <br>

                                            <li>
                                                To Increase Trust and Transparency. By being able to trace items along the supply chain, manufacturers and customers will be able to trust one another. Manufacturers will be able to ensure that the items they wish to provide are delivered safely to the
                                                intended customer. Clients, on the other hand, will be able to see that the goods they wish to buy was created by a reputable company and that they received it in its original state. Hash function provide
                                                a chain of continues related blocks, no one can change or delete anything in the ledger. Each transaction will be on this ledger on each node on the network. In other words, this QR code (product ID) will
                                                have related chain from manufacturer to the end customer.Each node in the chain owns a productid has ability to transfer this product ownership to another node in the network.

                                                Extended Security. Blockchain is widely regarded as one of the world's most secure ledger systems which providing all the three components of the CIA triad. Blockchain is an immutable database, which means that information recorded on it cannot be erased
                                                or updated once it has been saved which provide the Integrity. Hash function connect the blocks where each block has the hash of previous one. Therefore, no one can change or replace any block even if there
                                                are two blocks created at the same time, the chain automatically changing with the longest one. Each node has a copy of the public ledger where the DoS attack is not possible which provide the Availability.
                                                Public and Private Keys will provide the Non repudiation and Authentication. Here the assets will be sent to the node’s public key and the signature will be calculated with the private key of the node.A
                                                permissioned Blockchain will be employed in the proposed system, which is more secure than a public Blockchain since only authentic players will be allowed credentials to push data to the Blockchain. Therefore,
                                                only manufacturers have the ability to generate and mine block with its related QR code for there products. Everyone else in the chain can create an account, have a wallet for their assets, and make a transaction
                                                to transfer the ownership from one to other in the chain.
